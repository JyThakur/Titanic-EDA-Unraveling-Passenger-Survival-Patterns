## **EDA steps to be accomplished** 
---
1. Reading and Understanding Data 
  - Checking for Incorrect Datatypes, Missing values and Null values 
  - Checking Outliers and Invalid values 
2. Data Visualization 
  - Comparing Survived against different variables 
    - Survived Vs Pclass 
    - Survived Vs Sex 
    - Survived Vs Age 
     - Survived Vs Age_Bins 
    - Survived Vs SibSp 
    - Survived Vs Parch 
    - Survived Vs Embarked 
3. Data Preparation 
  - Dropping Irrelevant variables 
  - Convert Categorical variables to Ordinal variables 
  - Visualize Correlation between all variables
